Since 2009 I have been involved as an organizer in a user group for .net developers in sweden called [SweNug](http://www.swenug.se) (Sweden .NET user group). This year a group of SweNug organizer in Stockholm (and some other people) decided to host a conference in the spirit of SweNug called [Swetugg](http://www.swetugg.se). The conference had about 200 visitors.

First of all I would like to thank all the participants, speakers and of course the organizers for a great conference with a great atmosphere and interesting presentations.

I had submitted a talk to this conference and it got accepted. The subject I choose to talk about was "Introduction to F#" where I started of talking about some basic concepts in functional programming like immutable datastructures and also why you as a systemdeveloper should care about functional programming. 

I went on showing some syntax from F# and talked about some keywords and type provides. If you would like to view my slides from the talk (in Swedish) you can download the [PDF here](http://1drv.ms/1LQRNpK).

At the end of my presentation I showed three examples of how I solved [FizzBuzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in F# and how to test your F# code with C#. This code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/robinridderholt/F--Katas/tree/master/FizzBuzz).

This was a great experience for me and although I was very nervous before my talk I think it went well and I'm looking forward to next time. 

**EDIT**
