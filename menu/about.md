I'm a developer with a passion for code and problem solving. My interest in programming started when I was about 11 years old with mostly copy/paste "coding" in ASP, PHP and JavaScript so when people ask me what I do I usually reply with I'm working with my hobby.

My education is mainly in .NET and C# but I try to broaden my horizon and for the last few years I have learned ReactJS, Redux and a lot more within the relm of JavaScript. I have also been bitten by the functional programming bug and started out with F# but I have also looked at ReasonML, Erlang, Elixir and Haskell.

I usually blog about stuff that I have recently discovered my self in an attempt to remember it better and perhaps learn something more along the way.
